Colonizing Mars presents many challenges, firstly surveying the landscape to ensure safe living conditions for humans.
Billions are being pumped into this endevour, and it is one of the best bets we have to preserving the human race following a catastrophic event on Earth.
We decided therefore to create a classical planning algorithm for sample collection with a mars rover.

The idea:
A group of Mars colonizers have crash-landed onto Mars after one of the engines of their rocket misfired. Realizing they would not survive the harsh conditions,
the colonizers decide to take shelter in a nearby cave. They make an SOS call to the colony and it is luckily heard.
The colony's emergency brigade quickly dispatches an autonomous fleet of rovers to collect the stranded colonizers.

The challenge:
The fleet of rovers have the following constraints:
	- They have limited battery resources - although they can recharge at designated charging stations
	- They cannot occupy the same positions at the same time
	- The colonizers may be badly wounded, therefore the fleet needs to get the colonizers home as soon as possible

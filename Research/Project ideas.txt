--IDEAS FOR PROJECT--

Delivery Service:
	- world: 
		- randomly generated map (streets etc)
		- locations where orders have been made
		- recharge stations
	- agents:
		- autonomous electric delivery vehicle
	- goal: 
		- deliver packages to locations where orders have been made 
		- plan for maximum packages delivered or minimum time, etc.
	- method: 
		- probably need motion planning if we want to generate interesting map
	- misc:
		- possibly have multiple delivery vehicles with the constraint that they cannot collide
		

Trip Planner:
	- world:
		- randomly generated map
		- start point and target destination
		- transport locations (busstops, bike racks, etc.)
	- agents:
		- human initially located at start point (???)
	- goal:
		- find the route with shortest distance or least cost in terms of money
	- method:
		- again, if we want an interesting map, motion planning may be used
	
		
Automized waitering service:
	- world:
		- tables with guests
		- kitchen
		- charging stations
	- agents:
		- robot waiters
	- goal:
		- take orders from guests, relay info to the kitchen, wait, return to guest with the food. Have robots be as 'busy' as possible (minimum idle time)
	- method:
		- classical planning with PDDL
		
Automized ride-sharing service
	-world:
		- customers
		- locations 
	- agents:
		- automized car
	-goal:
		- pick up and drop off guests in a way which minimizes battery usage or time in car
	- method:
		- temporal planning
